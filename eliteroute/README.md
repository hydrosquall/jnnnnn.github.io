This is a script that I wrote because I got annoyed about how slow Slopey's tool is. It has since improved but this is still faster for routes with many destinations.

It uses his data, so keep his tool running.

bestloop.py will calculate the most-profitable-per-destination trade route. The output of a typical run appears in results-loop.txt.

besttrade.py is a good way to find a profitable stopover on the way somewhere. The output of a typical run appears in results.txt.

stateexplorer.html is a visual way of exploring the results of the above scripts.
